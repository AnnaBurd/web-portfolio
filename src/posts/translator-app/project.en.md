## Introduction

The translator app is an essential tool for businesses that require accurate translations of technical documentation. While popular text translation tools like Google Translate and commercial deep-learning-based solutions are effective for common communication topics, they often fall short when it comes to less commonly used languages or highly specialized terminology.

For instance, the bi-lingual international company the application was initially designed for requires all technical documents to be provided in both Russian and Vietnamese languages. Unfortunately, existing translation tools frequently produce unreadable gibberish due to the narrow-field terminology involved. This results in a significant amount of manual labor being required on what should otherwise be an automatable task.

To address this issue, we have developed an AI-powered application designed specifically for enhancing the accuracy of translations by utilizing private databases with pre-existing samples from various fields and industries. By doing so, we can significantly improve efficiency while also reducing costs associated with manual corrections - ultimately providing better quality service overall!

## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Limited Documentation on Emerging AI Tools

One significant challenge faced during the development was the scarcity of documentation on modern AI tools. The application was conceived just after the emergence of these cutting-edge tools, making it challenging to find comprehensive resources. To overcome this hurdle, a proactive approach was taken to experiment, iterate, and collaborate with emerging tech communities to gather insights and share knowledge.

### 2. Translation Quality Enhancement

Enhancing the quality of translations posed a unique challenge, especially when dealing with less commonly used languages and highly specialized terminology. To address this, a semi-automated approach was adopted. Using JavaScript (JS) and VBA, a process was implemented to collect translation samples and refine the application's AI models. This iterative process not only improved the translation quality but also served as a valuable learning experience in refining language-specific nuances.

### 3. Rapid Learning Curve for New Technologies

The dynamic nature of the project demanded quick adaptation to unfamiliar technologies. Learning curves were steep, particularly with tools like Swagger. Swift action was taken to bridge the knowledge gap through self-directed learning and hands-on experimentation. This challenge turned into an opportunity for skill growth, showcasing the ability to adapt swiftly and effectively to evolving tech stacks.

## Key Takeaways üç¨

#### Dataset Expansion and Model Experimentation

We plan to embark on a comprehensive growth journey by expanding our private dataset. The collection of diverse and industry-specific translation samples will empower our AI models to handle an even broader range of technical documentation with proficiency. Concurrently, experimentation with different models will be a focal point, allowing us to refine and optimize our approach to meet evolving language challenges.

#### Manual Editing Empowerment

Recognizing the invaluable insights that users bring to the translation process, we aim to empower them further. Plans include the implementation of features that enable users to manually edit translations, providing a collaborative and user-centric approach to refining document content. This user-driven customization will play a pivotal role in tailoring translations to specific needs and preferences.

#### Bug Resolution and Feature Enhancement

Acknowledging the dynamic nature of software development, we are committed to continuously enhancing the user experience. This involves vigilant bug resolution to ensure a seamless and error-free operation. Additionally, we'll be introducing new features, with a notable addition being the implementation of an undo/redo functionality. This empowers users to effortlessly navigate through the translation process and correct any inadvertent mistakes.

These future plans embody our commitment to continuous improvement, innovation, and user satisfaction. By prioritizing translation quality, dataset growth, bug resolution, and empowering users with enhanced features, we aim to solidify our position as a leading solution in the realm of technical document translation.
