> Empowered by advanced AI model APIs (Open AI / Azure), this application facilitates seamless translations of technical documentation based on context.

The translator app is an essential tool for businesses that require accurate translations of technical documentation. While popular text translation tools like Google Translate and commercial deep-learning-based solutions are effective for common `communication topics`, they often fall short when it comes to less commonly used languages or highly specialized terminology. ü§î‚û°Ô∏èüöÄ

For instance, the bi-lingual international company the application was initially designed for requires all technical documents to be provided in both Russian **and Vietnamese languages**. Unfortunately, existing translation tools frequently produce unreadable gibberish due to the narrow-field terminology involved. This results in a significant amount of manual labor being required on what should otherwise be an automatable task.

To address this issue, we have developed an AI-powered application designed specifically for enhancing the accuracy of translations by utilizing private databases with pre-existing samples from various fields and industries. By doing so, we can significantly improve efficiency while also reducing costs associated with manual corrections - ultimately providing better quality `service overall`!

## Installation

Add `.env` file on place of the `.env.example` file in the root folder and fill in secret api/database tokens.

Linux & Windows:

```bash {3..4}
npm install     # Install dependencies
npm run dev     # Run in development mode

npm run build   # Build production version
npm start       # Run
```

Docker:

```bash {3}
# Build files
npm run build

# Build docker image
docker build -t <any-image-name:tag> .

# Push image to the docker hub
docker tag <any-image-name:tag> <docker-username>/<any-image-name:tag>
docker push <docker-username>/<any-image-name:tag>

# Run docker container using image, locally or on hosting
# When running container, make sure to expose port that is specified in the .env PORT variable, and to update api URL on the frontend side

```

This will run the backend (api) part of the application, the frontend (client) is [here](https://github.com/AnnaBurd/translator-app-ts-front)

## Wrapping up

This is my very-first tutorial on Next.js! üçæ

I've been using Next.js to build a custom platform for my upcoming course, CSS for JavaScript Developers. It's a course specifically for JS developers who struggle with CSS. I know from experience that CSS becomes a lot more fun once you get comfortable with it, and being able to switch effortlessly between JS and CSS is absolutely wonderful. Follow the link to learn more!

Special thanks to Brandon for the router-based solution! Brandon's working on Blitz.js, an exciting framework built on top of Next.js that aims to recreate the Rails experience, and I'm super excited to see where it goes üíØ
