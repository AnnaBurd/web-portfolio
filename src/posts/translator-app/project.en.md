## One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams

One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself _transformed_ in his bed into a horrible [vermin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermin "Wikipedia Vermin"). He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.

The bedding was hardly able to cover **strong** it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, link waved abouthelplessly as he looked.

he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls.
