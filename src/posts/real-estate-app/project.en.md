## Goals and Requirements

The main objective of this project was to **help the local business establish a strong connection with potential customers** and create an outstanding first impression, ultimately giving the business a distinct advantage amidst the fiercely demanding marketplace.

Initial constraints that we needed to address:

- user-friendly design with an understanding of local language and cultural distinctiveness
- competitive performance on mobile devices
- smooth delivery and uncomplicated content management processes
- **restricted budget** üòπ

## Development Approach

In this particular scenario, the approach taken was to **generate static pages** rather than rely on client-side or server-side rendering. The client-side rendering was ruled off due to the significance placed on mobile performance and search engine optimization (SEO). Meanwhile, the idea of spending on the development/hosting/management of the backend side ruled off the server-side rendering approach as well. Instead of overinvesting in the backend infrastructure, we choose the services of the headless CMS (with generous free tiers).

And, although static pages sound ‚Ä¶ _**lifeless**_, the app pages have been designed in a manner that does not give off a static impression entirely! The **secret is the usage of component-based islands of JS interactivity** whenever necessary.
