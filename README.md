In the ever-evolving digital landscape, **personal branding** is not merely a choice - it's a necessity, especially in the fiercely competitive job market for aspiring developers. A **standout portfolio is a contemporary requirement nowadays** - without one, the journey to securing your first job can be an uphill battle.

Fortunately, there's no shortage of open-source portfolios for inspiration. You can explore curated lists such as:

1. [emmabostian/developer-portfolios](https://github.com/emmabostian/developer-portfolios)
   > A compilation of developer portfolios for your creative inspiration.
2. [Evavic44/portfolio-ideas](https://github.com/Evavic44/portfolio-ideas)
   > A curation of awesome portfolio website ideas for developers and designers to draw inspiration from.
3. [Renovamen/playground-macos](https://github.com/Renovamen/playground-macos)
   > An innovative portfolio website that simulates the macOS GUI.

However, most existing portfolios are written exclusively in English (or another single language), leaving a gap for those who communicate in multiple languages.

This project addresses that gap, concentrating on **multilingual beginner developers and freelancers**, offering robust internationalization support (with i18n). On the downside, it multiplies the task of content writing, necessitating a copy for each language you know.
